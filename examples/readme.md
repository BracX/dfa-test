# Fauton Examples

1. Run `npm run install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to transpile ts to js
3. Move to `dist` directory and execute the relevant script.

All the examples have been written in ts to keep them updated with the latest api. A build step will make sure that all the examples can be compiled using the current version of fauton or fail otherwise.
